            <h2>My Hometown</h2>
            <p>I'm from Hong Kong, a tiny spot on the world map.</p>
            <h2>My Passion</h2>
            <p>I'm enthusiastic about traveling, always eager to explore new places and immerse myself in different cultures. When I'm not on the road, you'll find me swimming, bouldering, or enjoying a good anime series. I also love diving into video games, which offer a perfect escape and a chance to unwind. Each of these interests adds a unique dimension to my life, keeping it both thrilling and balanced. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for the next adventure, whether it's a new destination or a new game.</p>
            <h2>My aspiration</h2>
            <p>As an optometrist and programmer, I aspire to integrate technology with eye care to enhance patient outcomes. I aim to develop innovative solutions that improve diagnostics and streamline workflows. By staying current in both fields, I hope to contribute to transformative research and applications in vision care. My goal is to make eye care more accessible and personalized through technology. Ultimately, I want to bridge healthcare and tech to advance global well-being.</p>
